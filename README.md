Meta learner is a type of machine learning algorithm that can learn how to learn. This means that it can adapt to new environments and situations, and improve its performance over time. Meta learning is a relatively new area of research, but it has the potential to greatly enhance the capabilities of AI systems.

Activation functions are a critical component of neural networks, which are a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Activation functions determine how much signal is passed on from one neuron to the next in the network, based on the input received.

For classification tasks, activation functions help to map the input data to a set of discrete outputs, such as labels or class probabilities. Common activation functions used for classification tasks include the softmax function and the sigmoid function.

For regression tasks, activation functions help to map the input data to a continuous output, such as a numerical value or a range of values. Common activation functions used for regression tasks include the linear function and the hyperbolic tangent function.
